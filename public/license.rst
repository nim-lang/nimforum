Forum content license
=====================

All the content contributed to the Nim Forum is `cc-wiki (aka cc-by-sa)
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/>`_ licensed, intended to be
**shared and remixed**. In the future we may even provide all this data as a
convenient data dump.

But our cc-wiki licensing, while intentionally permissive, does **require
attribution**::

    **Attribution** — You must attribute the work in the manner specified by
    the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse
    you or your use of the work).

Let us clarify what we mean by attribution. If you republish this content, we
require that you:

* **Visually indicate that the content is from the Nim Forum**. It doesn’t
  have to be obnoxious; a discreet text blurb is fine.
* **Hyperlink directly to the original post** (e.g.,
  http://forum.nim-lang.org/t/186)
* **Show the author names** for every post.
* **Hyperlink each author name** directly back to their user profile page
  (e.g., http://forum.nim-lang.org/profile/Araq)

By “directly”, we mean each hyperlink must point directly to our domain in
standard HTML visible even with JavaScript disabled, and not use a tinyurl or
any other form of obfuscation or redirection. Furthermore, the links must not
be `nofollowed
<http://googleblog.blogspot.com.es/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html>`_.

This is about the spirit of fair **attribution**. Attribution to the website,
and more importantly, to the individuals who so generously contributed their
time to create that content in the first place!

Feel free to remix and reuse to your heart’s content, as long as a good faith
effort is made to attribute the content!

Content previous to the forum license change of
http://forum.nim-lang.org/t/186 remains under the original authors'
copyright, and therefore you cannot reuse it.
